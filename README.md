Human Centred Inclusive Mobile Assistance for Yojana Access.

# What is the back story of HIMAYA?

HIMAYA is not a project at large  it is a effort to connect our people in *Uttarakhand* with government schemes which are put in place to support them. We see that the primary issue for a farmer or a homemaker in uttarakhand* isn’t the scheme which has been designed, but the fact that they are hard to access. Language barriers, technical jargon, and poor internet are the issues which make it a daunting task. We built HIMAYA to change that. It’s an “Apka Uttarakhandi Sahayak”  a companion which speaks your language and works without a perfect signal.

# Tailored for our local audience 

• ⁠Talk, don’t type:* We understand that your voice is more intimate. You can request schemes in *Hindi* or *English* just press a button. 

• ⁠Built for the hills:* The Internet is problematic in our area. HIMAYA works offline, so information is always available when you need it. 

• ⁠Straightforward Eligibility:* No complicated paperwork. Simply respond to a few basic questions about yourself, and we will tell you which schemes are applicable to you. 

• ⁠  Design for everyone:* From advanced smartphones to basic phones, our design is clean, fast, and easy on the eyes.

# 🚀 How to start it up

If you're a developer looking to lend a hand or are just experimenting locally:

1. The Backend (API) 
 
    "npm install" : To install node modules.

    "npm start" : To start the WebApp.

By doing this, the server is started on port 3000.

2. The Frontend (PWA)

A contemporary Progressive Web application is HIMAYA. Simply open frontend/index.html in your browser. It is quick and light.

# 🛠️ Our Toolbox

• Simple & Light: To keep things fast, we used Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

• Our API is powered by Node.js and Express, which provide a reliable backend.

• Community Focus: A carefully curated list of programs that are important to the people of Uttarakhand.

• Smart Caching: Offline support is integrated so you're never left in the dark.

# Why we take this action

Our objective is straightforward: We want to ensure that everyone is aware of their rights and has access to the assistance they are due. Just because a website is too complicated or uses incorrect language shouldn't cause anyone to fall behind.

--- Made with love and care for the Uttarakhand community.
